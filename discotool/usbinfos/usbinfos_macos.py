"""
We call a system command (system_profiler) to list USB devices. At least it outputs json. We find the serial ports by comparing vid, pid and serial number or location_id with the information from pyserial.

Virtual drives that don't appear by name in  SPSUSBDataType are found through psutil.disk_partitions() and their bsd_name.

We find the microbits volumes by matching the serial number on the volume with the one in the USB. Otherwise the volume does not seem to be listed in system_profiler.
