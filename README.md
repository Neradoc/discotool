## DiscoTool
Module and tool to discover all boards connected to USB.

![(Pimoroni Tiny2040, Arduino Nano 2040, Adafruit Huzzah ESP32)](docs/list_tiny_nano_esp32.png)

## Installing
The `discotool` command line program and the `discotool` python module for python 3 can be installed with pip.
```
python3 -m pip install discotool-for-microcontrollers
```

## Compatibility
It currently runs on MacOS, Linux and Windows. The `requirements.txt` and `requirements-*.txt` files list the requirements per platform. The windows port still has issue and might be missing information. Help is welcome.

## discotool CLI tool

When running `discotool` while using a single board, it will be automatically selected for commands. These are the commands I use the most:
- **`discotool repl`**: to connect to the REPL.
- **`discotool install ...`**: to install modules via circup.
- **`discotool update`**: to update modules via circup.

I often have more than one board connected, and connect to the REPL using `discotool -n pico` for example, or using the drive (mount) name to give each board a personnal name `discotool -m picotwo`.

I also use a command to back up all connected boards.
```
alias cpbackups='discotool backup --date ~/Backups/CPBackups'
```

### Configuration

Define environment variables to override the default command line tools used by discotool. They are called by appending the relevant parameters at the end of the command, or replacing a placeholder.
- **`DISCOTOOL_SERIALTOOL`**: (`screen`/`PuTTY`) command to connect to the REPL (tio, picocom, etc.), adds the port at the end or replaces `{port}` if present.
- **`DISCOTOOL_CIRCUP`**: (`circup`) command to call circup (`pip install` it for the default).
- **`DISCOTOOL_NOCOLOR`**: disables colors in the output if it evaluates to True.

### Command line options

- **`--wait`**: runs the scan every second until it detects a board.
- **`--nocolor`**: do not output colors in the terminal (overrides all else).
- **`--color`**: output colors in the terminal (overrides all else).
- **`--info`**: add more informations on Circuitpython boards by scanning the drive's content (might trigger the autoreload).

#### No Command

- if no filter is given, run the `list` command.
- if filters are given, run the `repl` command.

#### Filters
Filters select boards from the list of devices found to run a command on them. They are combined with OR logic: anything that matches any filter is selected. All filters are NOT case sensitive. Filters are simple text matches, they don't support wildcards.

- **`--auto`**: select the first board found.
- **`--name`**: search in the USB name/description field. Eg: "clue", "QT", "S2".
- **`--serial`**: search the serial number of the board.
- **`--mount`**: search the volume names of the board. Eg: "CIRCUITPY".

#### Commands

-	**`list`**: lists the selected boards, with name, manufacturer, serial number. Lists the serial ports and file volumes. If the `--info` option was given, identifies circuitpython code files present, as well as CPY version. On windows the name of the drive is listed in addition to the drive letter.
-	**`repl`**: connect to the REPL of the selected boards using the tool specified, screen by default, choosing the first serial port found if there is more than one.
-	**`eject`**: eject all selected board drives, or all found if no filter given. (MacOS only for now)
-	**`backup <destination dir> [<sub dir>]`**: copy the content of the selected boards drives into the destination dir or the optional sub dir (that will be created for you). Each board is put in a directory with its name and serial number.
	-	**`--create`**: create the destination dir if it does not exist.
	-	**`--date`**: use a time stamp as subdirectory name, or add to the supplied name.
-	**`circup <options>`**: calls circup with its `--path` option to each selected board and passes all other options and commands to it.
-	**`get <key>`**: print just the value for the key, for the selected devices. Can be used with backticks and such in a shell script. Includes special keys:
	- **`pid`**, **`vid`**, **`sn`**: shortcuts for product_id, vendor_id and serial_num.
	- **`volume`**: path to the (first) mounted drive of the device.
	- **`port`**: (first) serial port of the device.
	- **`repl`**: (first) REPL serial port of the device.
	- **`cdc`**: (first) non-REPL serial port of the device.
	- **`main`** or **`code.py`**: full path to the main file for circuitpython.
-	**`json`**: print the output of usbinfo as json for all selected boards.
	- **`--pretty`** **`-p`**: pretty print it for human reading.


## Module
Exposes the `get_identified_devices(drive_info=False)` function. Find boards on the host's USB bus and tries to match them with serial ports and mounted drives, virtual or not. If `drive_info` is True, when a drive is found, it reads circuitpython information if available: CPY version number and main files in order of priority (code.py, etc.). This might trigger the board's autoreload.
```python
import discotool
devicesList = discotool.get_identified_devices(drive_info=True)
```
Devices list (MacOS)
```python
[{
	'manufacturer': 'Adafruit Industries LLC',
	'name': 'CLUE nRF52840 Express',
	'ports': [{
		"dev": "'/dev/cu.usbmodem144443111'",
		"iface": "CircuitPython CDC data"
	}],
	'product_id': 32882,
	'serial_num': 'F88EE0399C0E1FC6',
	'vendor_id': 9114,
	'version': '6.0.1',
	'volumes': [{
		'mains': ['code.py'],
		'mount_point': '/Volumes/CIRCUITPY',
		'name': 'CIRCUITPY'
	}]
}]
```

### Other functions of the module

- **`get_devices_list(drive_info=False)`**: return a tuple of the devices list and the list of remaining unidentified serial ports `(devicesList, remainingPorts)`.
- **`get_identified_devices(drive_info=False)`**: only return the devices list.
- **`get_unidentified_ports()`**: only return the unidentified serial ports.
- **`devices_by_name(name)`**: only return the devices where the name contains the given string (not case sensitive).
- **`devices_by_drive(drive_name)`**: only return the devices where the drive name (by default CIRCUITPY) is the given string.
- **`devices_by_serial(serial_number)`**: only return the devices where the serial number is the given string (not case sensitive).

### The DeviceInfoDict class
The device list is actually a list of DeviceInfoDict, a subclass of dictionary that adds a few properties as shortcuts for paths in the dictionary, with a default value of `None`.

- **`repl`**: REPL port, if any.
- **`data`**: data port, if any.
- **`drive`** and **`volume`**: board drive path.
- **`volume_name`**: board drive name.
- **`vid`**: shortcut for `vendor_id`.
- **`pid`**: shortcut for `product_id`.
