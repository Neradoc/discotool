## USB Infos / Disco Tool
Module and tool to discover all boards connected to USB.

### usbinfos module
Exposes the getDeviceList() function. Find boards on the host's USB bus and tries to match them with serial ports and mounted drives, virtual or not. When a drive is found, it lists circuitpython information if available: CPY version number and main files (code.py, etc.). Returns the list of boards found with their information, and a list of unmatched serial ports.
```python
[{
	'manufacturer': 'Adafruit Industries LLC',
	'name': 'CLUE nRF52840 Express',
	'ports': [{
		"dev": "'/dev/cu.usbmodem144443111'",
		"iface": "CircuitPython CDC data"
	}],
	'product_id': 32882,
	'serial_num': 'F88EE0399C0E1FC6',
	'vendor_id': 9114,
	'version': '6.0.1',
	'volumes': [{'mains': ['code.py'], 'mount_point': '/Volumes/CPCLUE'}]
}]
```

## Operating system
It currently runs on macOSâ„¢ (Catalina) using a system tool, and on linux using udev.  
Python modules required: `python3 -m pip install pyserial psutil click` and `pyudev` on linux.

## usbtool.py use

Define environment variables to override the default command line tools used by discotool. They are called by appending the relevant parameters at the end.
- `DISCOTOOL_SERIALTOOL` (`screen`) command to connect to the REPL (tio, picocom, etc.)
- `DISCOTOOL_CIRCUP` (`circup`) command to call circup (`pip install` it for the default)
- `DISCOTOOL_NOCOLOR` disables colors in the output if it evaluates to True

### Command line options

- **`--wait`**: runs the scan every second until it detects a board.
- **`--nocolor`**: do not output colors in the terminal (overrides all else).
- **`--color`**: output colors in the terminal (overrides all else).

#### Filters
Filters select boards from the list of devices found to run a command on them. They are combined with OR logic: anything that matches any filter is selected. All filters are NOT case sensitive. Filters are simple text matches, they don't support wildcards.

- **`--auto`**: select the first board found. For when a single board is connected.
- **`--name`**: search in the USB name/description field. Eg: "clue", "QT", "S2".
- **`--serial`**: search the serial number of the board.
- **`--mount`**: search the volume names of the board. Eg: "CIRCUITPY".

#### No Command

- if no filter is given, run the `list` command
- if filters are given, run the `repl` command

#### Commands

-	**`list`** lists all the boards that have been detected, with name, manufacturer, serial number. Lists the serial ports and file volumes, identifying circuitpython code files present, as well as CPY version.
-	**`repl`** connect to the REPL of the selected boards using the tool specified, screen by default, choosing the first serial port found if there is more than one.
-	**`eject`** eject all selected board drives, or all found if no filter given. (macOS only for now)
-	**`backup <destination dir> [<sub dir>]`** copy the content of the selected boards drives into the destination dir or the optional sub dir (that will be created for you). Each board is put in a directory with its name and serial number.
	-	**`--create`** create the destination dir if it does not exist.
	-	**`--date`** use a time stamp as subdirectory name, or add to the supplied name.
-	**`circup <options>`** calls circup with its `--path` option to each selected board and passes all other options and commands to it.
-	**`get <key>`** print just the value for the key, for the selected devices. Can be used with backticks and such in a shell script. Includes special keys:
	- **`pid`**, **`vid`**, **`sn`**: shortcuts for product_id, vendor_id and serial_num.
	- **`volume`**: path to the (first) mounted drive of the device.
	- **`port`**: (first) serial port of the device.
	- **`repl`**: (first) REPL serial port of the device.
	- **`cdc`**: (first) non-REPL serial port of the device.
	- **`main`** or **`code.py`**: full path to the main file for circuitpython.
-	**`json`** print the output of usbinfo as json for all selected boards.
	- **`--pretty`**: pretty print it for human reading.
